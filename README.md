**Learning Data Analysis with Challenges:**

1. Learn Data Exploration with Pandas by Analysing the Post-University Salaries of Graduates by Major
   > How to explore a Pandas DataFrame
   > How to detect NaN (not a number) values and clean your data
   > How to select particular columns, rows, and individual cells
   > How to sort your data
   > How to group data by category

8. Analysing a dataset on the past winners of the Nobel Prize.
   > Create a Choropleth to display data on a map.
   > Create bar charts showing different segments of the data with plotly.
   > Create Sunburst charts with plotly.
   > Use Seaborn's .lmplot() and show best-fit lines across multiple categories using the row, hue, and lowess parameters.
   > Understand how a different picture emerges when looking at the same data in different ways (e.g., box plots vs a time series analysis).
   > See the distribution of our data and visualise descriptive statistics with the help of a histogram in Seaborn.
