**Learning Data Analysis with Challenges:**

1. Learn Data Exploration with Pandas by Analysing the Post-University Salaries of Graduates by Major
   > How to explore a Pandas DataFrame
   > How to detect NaN (not a number) values and clean your data
   > How to select particular columns, rows, and individual cells
   > How to sort your data
   > How to group data by category

2. Matplotlib Exercises
   > Creating plots from equations
   > Creating plots from data points
   
3. Pandas Project Exercise
   > Working with Dataframes columns and rows
   > Conditional Filtering
   > Apply method
   > Pandas Operations
   > Hierarchical indexing
   > Merging types
   > Input and output
   > Pivot Tables
   
4. Google Play Store App Analytics

5. Computation with NumPy and n-dimensional arrays.
   > Analyse the shape and dimensions of a ndarray
   > Slice and subset a ndarray based on its indices
   > Do linear algebra like operations with scalars and matrix multiplication
   > Use NumPys broadcasting to make ndarray shapes compatible
   > Manipulate images in the form of ndarrays

6. Seaborn and Linear Regression on Movie budgets and Revenue data
   > Remove unwanted characters from multiple columns
   > Filter Pandas DataFrames based on multiple conditions using both .loc[] and .query()
   > Create bubble charts using the Seaborn Library
   > Style Seaborn charts using the pre-built styles and by modifying Matplotlib parameters
   > Use floor division (i.e., integer division) to convert years to decades
   > Use Seaborn to superimpose a linear regressions over our data
   > Make a judgement if our regression is good or bad based on how well the model fits our data and the r-squared metric
   > Run regressions with scikit-learn and calculate the coefficients. 

7. Google Trends Data
  

8. Analysing a dataset on the past winners of the Nobel Prize - with Plotly, Matplotlib and Seaborn
   > Create a Choropleth to display data on a map.
   > Create bar charts showing different segments of the data with plotly.
   > Create Sunburst charts with plotly.
   > Use Seaborn's .lmplot() and show best-fit lines across multiple categories using the row, hue, and lowess parameters.
   > Understand how a different picture emerges when looking at the same data in different ways (e.g., box plots vs a time series analysis).
   > See the distribution of our data and visualise descriptive statistics with the help of a histogram in Seaborn.

9. Using Dr Semmelweis's 1800's investigation into why so many women in maternity wards were dying from childbed fever to:
    > Make a compelling argument using data
    > Superimpose histograms to show differences in distributions
    > Use a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) to show a graphic estimate of a distribution.
    > Use scipy and test for statistical significance by looking at p-values.
    > Highlight different parts of a time series chart in Matplotib.
    > Add and configure a Legend in Matplotlib.
    > Use NumPy's .where() function to process elements depending on a condition.
